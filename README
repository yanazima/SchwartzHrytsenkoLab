 1. Driver script: run all the files in sequential order (ADD THIS FILE)
 2. Process fastq.gz files with JellyFish package to get kmer frequencies: processJellyFish.py
    Usage: python processJellyFish.py 12 , where 12 is any k-value (except 7-9, jellyfish is lagging on this values)
 3. Read in .fa files, put them into dictionaries, pickle them: pickleFAsDict.py
 4. Read in .pickle dictionaries, calculate Cosine distances between them with Tensorflow package, output results as a .txt file: run calcDistTF.py with processPair.sh
 5. Read in from .txt the distances and put them into a .pickle dictionary: readFromOutDist.py
 6. Read in .pickle dictionary containing distances and output dendrogram: makeDendroClean.py
 7. To check how data changes with filtered out frequencies use: calcDistTF.py with if statement >100 etc.
 8. To check the closest neighbor to a sample use: python checkClosestNeighbour.py 12MersDistancesResultsGreater1_000_000.pickle
 9. To plot closest neighbor use: python plotClosestNeighbor.py 12MersDistancesResultsGreater1000.pickle
 10.To plot HeatMap for all the 600 distances between each pair of samples use: HeatMaps.py
 11. To calculate a fraction of discarded frequencies use: runDiscardedCalc.sh which runs getFractionOfDiscardedFrequencies.py
 12. To make a histogram of the frequencies use makeHisto.py
 13. To filter out frequencies run: filteringFreq.sh wich runs filteringFrequencies.py
