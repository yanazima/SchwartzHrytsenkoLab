 1. Driver script: run all the files in sequential order (ADD THIS FILE)
 2. Process fastq.gz files with JellyFish package to get kmer frequencies: processJellyFish.py
 3. Read in .fa files, put them into dictionaries, pickle them: pickleFAsDict.py
 4. Read in .pickle dictionaries, calculate Cosine distances between them with Tensorflow package, output results as a .txt file: run calcDistTF.py with processPair.sh
 5. Read in from .txt the distances and puth them into a .pickle dictionary: readFromOutDist.py
 6. Read in .pickle dictionary containing distances and output dendrogram: makeDendrogram.py
